Question 5: What is a so called “branch” in Git terms and why would you use it?

Answer: A branch is a pointer that points to the last "snapshot" that has been comitted by the user.
	Because of this one can construct several branches to "save" the progress made untill the commit and it makes it possible
	to work in only that "snapshot" and keep the changes seperated.
