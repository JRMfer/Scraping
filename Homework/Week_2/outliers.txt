Histogram:
When plotting the first histogram I noticed that there was an extremely high
value for Surinam. Because it is not likely that the average person in
Surinam earns that amount of money it is not a correct representation of the
country. Therefore I removed this outlier from the data frame and plotted a new
histogram without the outlier and also for the remainder of the analysis.
